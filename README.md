# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm


## Abstract
This study explores how different prompting strategies influence the quality of AI-generated text summaries. Using the task of summarizing a technical article on blockchain, four prompting techniques—zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-based—were tested across multiple AI platforms. The results were evaluated using a rubric of accuracy, coherence, simplicity, speed, and user experience. Findings indicate that role-based and few-shot prompts often produce more student-friendly and coherent summaries, while zero-shot is fastest but less tailored.

## 1.	Introduction
Text summarization is a critical task in education, enabling quick understanding of complex technical topics. With the rise of AI platforms, content teams increasingly rely on automated summarization. However, the prompting strategy used plays a major role in shaping the output.

## 2.	Background
Text summarization condenses long text into a shorter, meaningful version while retaining key ideas. Prompting in AI refers to the way instructions are given to large language models, significantly impacting response quality.

## 3.	Prompting Techniques
Zero-Shot: Directly asking the AI to summarize without examples.
Few-Shot: Providing examples of summaries before requesting the output.
Chain-of-Thought: Asking the AI to reason step-by-step before summarizing.
Role-Based: Assigning the AI a persona such as an educator simplifying blockchain.


## 4.	Experiment Setup
Task: Summarize a 500-word technical article on Blockchain. Platforms: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude.
Prompts: Each technique applied consistently.

## 5.	Evaluation Metrics
1.	Accuracy
2.	Coherence
3.	Simplicity
4.	Speed
5.	User Experience


## 6.	Methodology
Each prompting technique was tested on all platforms using the same blockchain article. Prompts were carefully crafted and results evaluated using both automated metrics and human judgment.
 
## 7.	Results and Comparison
Role-based prompting consistently provided the best balance of accuracy, coherence, and simplicity, though slightly slower than zero-shot. Few-shot improved coherence significantly, while chain-of-thought enhanced logical flow but was time-intensive.

## 8.	Discussion
Zero-shot was fastest but lacked depth. Few-shot balanced performance but required more prompt design. Chain-of-thought ensured logical flow but was verbose. Role-based emerged as the most effective for educational purposes.

## 9.	Conclusion
Role-based prompting is recommended for educational content. Few-shot can supplement for improved coherence. Zero-shot suits quick responses, while chain-of-thought is best for deep reasoning.

## Comparison: ChatGPT vs Gemini
Why ChatGPT is Best:
1.	Delivers more consistent and reliable responses.
2.	Provides smoother conversational flow.
3.	Adapts well to user needs.
4.	Offers detailed yet easy-to-understand explanations.
5.	Better user support and accessibility.
 



## Result
Hence , evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization is verified
